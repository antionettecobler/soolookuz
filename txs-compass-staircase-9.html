Hello, prospective recruits, current recruits, soldiers, veterans, lurkers, and friends. My name doesn't matter. I finished BMQ a month ago, and during that time, I took a lot of notes on our daily activities and documented my everyday life. I'm a person who journals regularly and I've done it for over 10 years; I knew basic training wasn't gonna stop my hot streak. I had plans from the start to put something out there that'll give people a better idea of what BMQ is like. Previous Chapter (Prelude) (https://www.reddit.com/r/resonatingfury/comments/auu409/the_rerewrite_of_dreams_my_first_novel_attempt) ------ "It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live." I refuse to accept that mentality. Dreams are what drive us as humans; they're how we strive past what we are today in search of a better tomorrow. What's so fallible about getting a little lost now and again? Is the mundane acceptance of a linear path really a life worth living? I think Hey guys, amp#x200B; I made an attacking strat for the non 5-stacks playing in siege. This can be used for solo players, and even 2-stacks or 3-stacks. amp#x200B; I am not an expert or diamond player, i am just about to hit level 200 and was looking for tips on all kinds of sites, combined them, and this is what i came up with. amp#x200B; If you have any addition or more tips to make this more succesfull , please let me know in the comments so i can add this. amp#x200B; Loadout. The mods I installed are treecapitator and Enchanting Plus, although I did not install the latter until I had already tried normal enchanting twice and remembered how annoying it is. I played a lot of this game for years back when I played. Between solo survival and hanging out on massive online servers, even being a mod for one, I'd seen a lot. The world I generated for this survival run is by far the best world I've ever experienced in solo survival. I spawned in the middle of a desert. I think it is time this community creates a master list of quality of life improvements needed, if we can get this list to be used, I will keep it updated as people add to it. Quality of life meaning, things that aren't necessarily bugs but would be nice to have for enjoyment of playing the game. Items are listed in no particular order. Sight Pictures on scopes and sights are very difficult to see, or in the case of the chameleon perk absolutely impossible. Colors of the cross-hairs. so i quit weed about three weeks ago and have been getting some wild af dreams so I'm going to get them down to boost my dream recollection as well as try recognize patterns that should turn them lucid in future, I've had multiple lucid dreams back in the day so i know what to do. Writing this down as a personal spot to collect my dreams but anyone can feel free to read - 21 March 2019 Writing this one the day after so my memory of it is hazy. Anyways, I'm in a Cessna 172 doing spin recove. We began my heroes out in Daggerford. My players wanted to roll new characters, so I just dropped them off there. Having no history with Daggerford, I made up that they helped the local townsfolk with some pest issues, which warranted them an invite from Duchess Morwen to a get together where she confessed her concerns over a small band of Vistani that seemingly popped up over night. The players agreed to deliver her message to them: that if they don't pack up and leave I wanna talk about it as a game instead of posting it's awesome waifus for a sec. One second. You'll live. (Narrartor: but, like the in game cutscenes, it took many seconds.) I've put 26 hours in holy shit this is my kinda game. I feel like 18 of those hours are sitting in the menu trying to make builds and I love it. I didn't play before the implementation of easy mode, but I have tried normal and good God is that a bit too grindy for a new guy like me. 22hrs in and they're going "okay
